This study, through its multi-method design, has validated the mediating role of cognitive reappraisal in the relationship between implicit emotion beliefs and subjective well-being, providing empirical support for the relevant field. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the simplified experimental scenarios (e.g., reading materials, scrambled-sentence task) may not fully simulate complex emotional processes as they occur in reality, potentially limiting the external validity of the findings. Future research could employ more sophisticated paradigms, such as analyzing individuals' natural language descriptions of emotional events, to measure implicit emotion beliefs and gather more direct behavioral evidence (Kisley et al., 2024). Alternatively, exploring novel methods like scenario-based measures (Savani et al., 2011; Peter et al., 2025) could help address the limitations inherent in traditional laboratory tasks. Second, although common method bias was statistically examined, the primary reliance on self-report data means that social desirability bias and recall bias cannot be entirely ruled out. Future studies could incorporate objective measures, such as physiological indicators or informant reports. Third, the sample consisted predominantly of university students, which restricts the generalizability of the conclusions. Furthermore, as most existing measurement tools were developed for adult populations, their applicability to developmental groups such as adolescents requires further validation (Peter et al., 2025). Future work should aim to develop measurement instruments with greater population-specific applicability.
